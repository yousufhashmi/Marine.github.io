                <h1>Marine</h1>
                <p>Seafarers have many stories to tell .</p>

                <h1>M.V. Swat goes to Hernosand </h1>
                <p>
                    National Shipping corporation in its golden days having two sister vessels m.v. Swat and m.v. Karotua

                    The vessels were made in England and have very typical accomodation.Total crew accomodation was built from 
                    forward to aft in the twin decks. Practicqlly the accomodation was in side holds.
                    M.V. Swat while staying in Port of Bremen got fire and its all accomodation was burnt. 
                    The whole accomodation was rebuilt in Ag Wesser shipyard in Bremen.

                    I joined m.v. Swat as fifth Engineer. My Chief Engineer was Mr. Badar Muneer and Mr. Fida Hussain.
                    in 1976 when I was 2nd Engineer on the same vessel we went to Hernosand (Sweden.)

                    Before approaching the port while the ship eas at sea the sea start freezing. and the temperature start dropping.
                    Captain took the assistance of ice breaker. And by following the ice breaker we docked in port.

                    The vessel was equipped with Doxford engine. As a 2nd Engineer I was on maneuvering stand and performing my duties as per the telegraphic order from the brige.
                    The temperature of the engine room started dropping rapidly.

                    The vessel had many special design features. One of it was that it has no forced blowers. instead two large natural ventillators were fitted. They can not be sealed effectively.

                    Soon I got message from the bridge that although the vessel is docked but we want to keep the engines on standbye.

                    However very soon all the cooling pumps started losing the suction. Atmospheric temperature dropped to minus forty. And the vessels systems start failing one by one.

                    Living quarters temperatures wer dropped to minus eight and the boiler although rinning could not take the load 
                    
                    The fresh water tanks which on the ship were double botttom tanks frozen and the sewage system also chocked.
                    we passed the night with very difficulty. Next day seaman's club team arrived with local media reporters.

                    The were furious that how people live in this condition.
                    Newspaper put hte heading on main page

                    <h2> PAKISTAN MOTOREN FROM PLUS 40 TO MINUS FORTY </h2>

                    They brought some warm clothing as gift pack for all crew. 

                    We were shifted to hotel and stayed there untill the temperature brought to normal. (minus 8)

                    Then as the vessel was not operational then the shore workshops assisted by providing heaters to warm the vessel and machinery.

                    It was a unique experience for all of us. And if some of old collegues have any foto then I can share.

                    After 10 years we encountereed similar weather condition in st.john Canada. The vessel was Malakand and I was 
                    Chief Engineer.
                    But the vessel was new and we passed the weather with out any problem
